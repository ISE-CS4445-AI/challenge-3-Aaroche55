Welcome to your $3^{rd}$ weekly challenge repository! ***Please read the following instructions and notes carefully before starting the challenge.***

## Instructions:
To start your challenge assignment, 
1. Launch the codespace for this repository by clicking the green '< > Code' button above.
2. Select the 'Codespaces' tab.
3. Click on the green 'Create codespace on main' button.
4. You will be redirected to a new tab where your codespace instance will initialise.
5. Once all package dependencies are automatically installed, you can start your challenge by opening the `challenge-1.ipynb` notebook.
   
## Important notes: 
- Remember to select your python notebook kernel from the top left of your notebook file before you run a code cell.
- After finishing your code, commit and push your changes to your repository after which the autograder will run.
  - Your notebook will be evaluated whose results you can see from the 'Actions' tab in your repository page or by clicking the orange dot beside your latest commit message. 
  - A green tick indicates all tests have passed successfully while a red cross means tests have failed. 
  - A detailed report can be viewed in the logs of the autograder workflow.
- You are ***NOT*** to use the internet or any external source of information for part 1 of this challenge assignment i.e., MCQ section. Part 2 is open book.
- Remember to download your completed notebook from either your codespace or your repository and submit it to the corresponding assignment page in Brightspace for your grade to be reflected for this challenge.
- Remember to close and shutdown your codespace instance after you are finished to avoid using up extra free codespace hours.
